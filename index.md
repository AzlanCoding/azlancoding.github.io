# Hello there!
Welcome to [azlancoding.github.io](https://azlancoding.github.io)
The homepage for **AzlanCoding** user
## Quicklinks
### [iframe browser](iframe-browser-pwa)
This is a browser that runs within a website. 
It needs an extension that will be prompted to install on first visit. 
The goal of this website is to bypass Mobile Guardian as it does not use a proxy. 
However, not all websites can work. 
Reddit for example will display here for a few seconds. 
>**Websites that seem to not work but actually do:**<br>
>>Spotify Web Player<br>
>>WhatsApp Web<br>
>>
To vist them in the iframe browser, you need to find the correct link and have the correct settings. <br>
Please contact me if you need help.<br>
It is password protected on certain timings during weekdays as my class uses it during lessons to play games.<br>
Passwords can be obtained upon request as long as AzlanCoding Agrees to give it to you.<br>

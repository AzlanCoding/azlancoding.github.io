### [iframe browser](iframe-browser-pwa)
This is a browser that runs within a website. 
It needs an extension that will be prompted to install on first visit. 
The goal of this website is to bypass Mobile Guardian as it does not use a proxy. 
However, not all websites can work. 
Reddit for example will display here for a few seconds.<br />
**Websites that don't work:**
 - Spotify Web Player
 - Reddit<br><br>

**Websites that [require further action](/whatsapp-and-others):**
 - WhatsApp Web<br><br>

Not all websites are listed here<br>
To vist them in the iframe browser, you need to find the correct link and have the correct settings. <br>
Please contact me if you need help.<br>
The installation guide can be found [here](https://azlancoding.github.io/iframe-browser/InstallGuide). <br>
The website is password protected on certain timings during weekdays as my class uses it during lessons to play games.<br>
Passwords can be obtained upon request as long as AzlanCoding agrees to give it to you.<br>
**For a better interface, it is reccomended to enable the `Desktop PWA tab strip` in `chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip` <br>

<br>

### Online Browser
Made to bypass Blocksi and Mobile Guardian on the iPad (Can't install the required extension for iframe-browser-pwa) <br>
**ATTENTION:**<br>
**After 28 November 2022, all of my heroku servers will shut down as Heroku will [discontinue all free Dynos](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter).<br> [online-browser-pwa](https://azlancoding.github.io/online-browser-pwa) will also no longer work**<br>
Three servers are avaliable:
1. [United States](https://online-browser-us.herokuapp.com/)
2. [Europe](https://online-browser-eur.herokuapp.com/)
3. [Replit(US)](https://online-browser.azlancoding.repl.co/) (Beta server. New functions are tested here before released)<br>

This project is originally by [S1monlol/pillow](https://github.com/S1monlol/pillow) <br>
Hosted by [Heroku: Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com/) <br>
Except the third one is hosted by [Replit: The collaborative browser based IDE](https://replit.com/)<br>
You may also visit [online-browser-pwa](https://azlancoding.github.io/online-browser-pwa) and install the PWA if you wish to.<br>
It uses an iframe to connect to the two servers.<br>
The website itself is hosted by github. <br>
It also attempts to hide page title and and favicon so that it doesn't appear in your history! <br>
**For a better interface, it is reccomended to enable the [Desktop PWA tab strip](chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip) in "chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip" for the online-browser-pwa** <br>
Note: The Android and iPad issues have been resolved. If you are still having issues, PLEASE contact me from that google button below.

### Virtual Browser Beta **(EXPERIMENTAL)**
Made to bypass any system as it uses a virtual machine to run chrome thanks [Replit: The collaborative browser based IDE](https://replit.com/). <br>

1. [Replit(US)](https://replit.com/@azlancoding/virtual-browser-beta?embed=true) <br>

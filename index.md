### [iframe browser](iframe-browser-pwa)
This is a browser that runs within a website. 
It needs an extension that will be prompted to install on first visit. 
The goal of this website is to bypass Mobile Guardian as it does not use a proxy. 
However, not all websites can work. 
Reddit for example will display here for a few seconds.<br />
**Websites that seem to not work but actually do:**
 - Spotify Web Player
 - WhatsApp Web

To vist them in the iframe browser, you need to find the correct link and have the correct settings. <br>
Please contact me if you need help.<br>
The installation guide can be found [here](https://azlancoding.github.io/iframe-browser/InstallGuide). <br>
The website is password protected on certain timings during weekdays as my class uses it during lessons to play games.<br>
Passwords can be obtained upon request as long as AzlanCoding agrees to give it to you.<br>
**For a better interface, it is reccomended to enable the [Desktop PWA tab strip](chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip) in "chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip"** <br>

### Online Browser **(NEW!!!)**
Made to bypass Blocksi and Mobile Guardian on the iPad (Can't install the required extension for iframe-browser-pwa) <br>
Three servers are avaliable:
1. [United States](https://online-browser-us.herokuapp.com/)
2. [Europe](https://online-browser-eur.herokuapp.com/)
3. [Replit(US)](https://online-browser.azlancoding.repl.co/) (Experimental! Current solution for Android and iPad problems)<br>

This project is originally by [S1monlol/pillow](https://github.com/S1monlol/pillow) <br>
Hosted by [Heroku: Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com/)  except the third one is hosted by [Replit: The collaborative browser based IDE](https://replit.com/)<br>
You may also visit [online-browser-pwa](https://azlancoding.github.io/online-browser-pwa) and install the PWA if you wish to. It uses an iframe to connect to the two servers. The website itself is hosted by github. <br>
**For a better interface, it is reccomended to enable the [Desktop PWA tab strip](chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip) in "chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip"** <br>
Note: I have had some feedback of the website not working on mobile devices (Andiod and iPad) and I am currently looking into this. For now, if you have that problem, please try the third server and contact me from the Gmail button at the bottom if you have any feedback. Thanks!
